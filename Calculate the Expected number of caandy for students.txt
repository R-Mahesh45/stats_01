Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child 
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)
CHILD	Candies count	Probability
A	1	0.015
B	4	0.20
C	3	0.65
D	5	0.005
E	6	0.01
F	2	0.120
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20

The expected number of candies for a randomly selected child can be calculated by multiplying each possible number of candies by the probability of that number of candies occurring, and then summing these values. This is also known as the expectation or expected value in probability theory.

Here’s how you can calculate it:

For child A, the expected number of candies is 1 * 0.015 = 0.015
For child B, the expected number of candies is 4 * 0.20 = 0.80
For child C, the expected number of candies is 3 * 0.65 = 1.95
For child D, the expected number of candies is 5 * 0.005 = 0.025
For child E, the expected number of candies is 6 * 0.01 = 0.06
For child F, the expected number of candies is 2 * 0.120 = 0.24
Adding these up, the expected number of candies for a randomly selected child is 0.015 + 0.80 + 1.95 + 0.025 + 0.06 + 0.24 = 3.09 candies.

So, on average, a randomly selected child is expected to have about 3.09 candies.
